<p>My personal opinion about AI, often falls under the &ldquo;anti&rdquo; stance. I believe that AI had a lot of promise upon it&rsquo;s initial release, but it has caused so much harm. There is a lot of harm that AI does to people, to the environment, and to our ability to reason or learn. <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/11/is-ai-dulling-our-minds/">Numerous studies</a> have dictated that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dimitarmixmihov/2025/02/11/ai-is-making-you-dumber-microsoft-researchers-say/">AI is making people use critical thinking skills less</a>. Artificial intelligence has a significant environmental impact, particularly concerning water usage. Data centers that support AI operations are projected to withdraw between <a href="https://nationalcentreforai.jiscinvolve.org/wp/2025/05/02/artificial-intelligence-and-the-environment-putting-the-numbers-into-perspective/">4.2 to 6.6 billion cubic meters of water by 2027</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/cindygordon/2024/02/25/ai-is-accelerating-the-loss-of-our-scarcest-natural-resource-water/">raising concerns about water scarcity in stressed regions</a>.</p>
<p>I am hyper-aware of this, and I&rsquo;m hyper-aware that I am a hypocrite by writing this. Before OpenAI&rsquo;s ChatGPT release in 2022, I had begun working for my company that specialised in Agentic Pentesting. When AI was still mystical, and future driven. I didn&rsquo;t know much about artificial intelligence prior to this, outside a brief course I did on machine learning. I thought about how much good we could do, how many people and their data we could protect if we could fully automate the pentesting process. I&rsquo;m still a firm believer in that. However, I also recognise the harm that is done now that these companies exist, and the harm they&rsquo;ve caused. Why am I admitting this?</p>
<p>That is because at work I still use AI.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t plan to hyper focus on that, I will talk about the ways I&rsquo;ve eliminated AI from my daily use, and how it&rsquo;s almost exclusively at work that I use AI now. I don&rsquo;t think elimination of AI in its entirety is necessary, but I do think it should be heavily limited, or restricted for use. That itself can be another blog post, and it may very well be. Today I will be focusing on the aspect of the critical thinking skills that AI dulls. You don&rsquo;t have to like me for this, or support my stance. Today I am a villian and I accept that, because the human experience is nuanced, and not black and white, and this blog post will be about <em>harm reduction</em>.</p>
<h1 id="why-claude">Why Claude?</h1>
<p>Recently a friend of mine sent me a link to <a href="https://quitgpt.org">quitgpt.org</a>. I have already been toying with the idea of leaving all AI platforms as much as possible, and have already taken those steps to eliminate it. I&rsquo;ve restricted AI in my browser, turned off AI features in all of my Google accounts, and other accounts where possible. I&rsquo;ve been toying with locally hosted models to reduce environmental impact, etc. However, I was a GPT user, since it was the first AI I tried when it came out, and sort of just stuck with it. After seeing <a href="https://quitgpt.org">quitgpt.org</a> I immediately requested my data, cancelled my subscription, and once my GDPR request has been fufilled, my account will be immediately deleted. This, was in a way, freeing.</p>
<p>However, everyone at work does use AI, and I&rsquo;ve struggled to keep up. Handwriting code isn&rsquo;t an issue, but when it takes me twice as much time as my colleagues, it looks terrible. I can&rsquo;t risk my job because it&rsquo;s what provides me my visa to stay and live in my country, and I don&rsquo;t want to be homeless again, in a country that doesn&rsquo;t feel like home. So, I adapted. I tried Claude in the past, but wasn&rsquo;t a big fan. However, I&rsquo;ve recently come back to it, after a lot of time, and I must say it&rsquo;s different. It&rsquo;s less focused on keeping you talking, or spending, and has more of a work focus. Specifically on development, code reviews, etc.</p>
<p>I already wanted to quit AI entirely, so immediately jumping into a new one wasn&rsquo;t thrilling for me. I wanted to make AI a tool again, not a crutch. Not something to fall back on, not something I have to attribute all my success to, and at the same time, I wanted AI that was safety and privacy focused, which is found far and few inbetween. Seeing how OpenAI has a kill count of 8 last I checked, and their involvement in the Trump administration,</p>
<h1 id="skillsmd">Skills.md</h1>
<p>So I made my own guardrails. I found myself becoming increasingly lazy, using less of my hacking skills and relying on AI to generate simple bash scripts, commands, or analysing large files. This has caused me to suffer a loss of being able to do the basics again in my field, which turned into imposter syndrome, which made me realize, it isn&rsquo;t imposter syndrome when you really are a fraud. I used to know how to program quite well, I was a developer for some time. Not being able to write a simple bash script felt embarassing, and rightfully so.</p>
<p>Therefore, I used one of Claude&rsquo;s features to help me keep my skills sharp while still maintaining enough output to ensure I won&rsquo;t look like the worst performer on the team. For the record, my manager and team are fantastic, and I know my manager does and will support me and defend me in my process of leaving AI behind, but other people outside our team looking at our metrics may not view that so favorbly, and I&rsquo;d be lying if I said companies don&rsquo;t have politics, because they do, and we have to play that game.</p>
<p>For those of you who don&rsquo;t know, Claude has something called a Skills.md. It&rsquo;s as simple as sending a prompt and saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s create a skill together using your skill-creator skill. First ask me what the skill should do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Together you can build what kind of skill you want, and what it should focus on. I decided to build myself a hacking coach. This way the AI isn&rsquo;t handing me answers to problems I want to solve, but rather coach me through them so I can rebuild the skillset myself.</p>
