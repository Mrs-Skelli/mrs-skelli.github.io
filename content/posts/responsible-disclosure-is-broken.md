# Preface

[Write your personal intro here: why you're writing this, what pushed you over the edge, and how long you've been dealing with disclosure drama.]

# The Ideal vs. Reality

[Talk about how responsible disclosure is *supposed* to work vs. how it actually goes in the real world.]

- **On paper**: Clear channels, quick acknowledgements, collaboration, and timelines.
- **In reality**: Ghosting, legal threats, endless bureaucracy, or "won't fix" for high-impact issues.

# Where It Breaks Down

## 1. Reporting Channels

[Describe issues like broken security.txt, dead bug bounty inboxes, or forms that go nowhere.]

## 2. Acknowledgement & Triage

[Discuss slow or nonexistent acknowledgements, poor triage, or downplaying impact.]

## 3. Communication

[Examples of vague replies, shifting goalposts, or being left on read for weeks or months.]

## 4. Legal & Power Imbalance

[Talk about the chilling effect of legal threats, hostile language in policies, or NDAs that silence researchers.]

# The Human Cost for Researchers

[How this affects your mental health, motivation, burnout, and willingness to report future bugs.]

# What Good Disclosure Looks Like

[List positive experiences or what you *wish* every program did.]

- **Clear policy** with scope, contact, and timelines
- **Fast acknowledgement** (even if triage takes time)
- **Honest communication** about impact, fixes, and constraints
- **Credit and transparency** where possible

# What Needs to Change

[Your concrete suggestions for organizations, vendors, CNAs, and platforms.]

- **For organizations**: [...]
- **For platforms/bug bounties**: [...]
- **For researchers**: [...]

# Final Thoughts

[Wrap up with how you feel about disclosure going forward, what you'll keep doing, and what you refuse to tolerate anymore.]
