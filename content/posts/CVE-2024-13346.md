# Unauthenticated Arbitrary Shortcode Execution - CVE-2024-13346

## Summary

I discovered a vulnerability in a WordPress plugin that allows unauthenticated users to execute arbitrary shortcodes. This can lead to various security issues including XSS, data exposure, and in some configurations, remote code execution.

## Timeline

- **March 15, 2024**: Vulnerability discovered while pentesting a client's website
- **March 18, 2024**: Reported to plugin vendor
- **March 25, 2024**: Vendor acknowledged the issue
- **April 2, 2024**: Patch released in version 2.5.8
- **April 5, 2024**: Public disclosure

## Technical Details

The vulnerability exists in the way the plugin processes user input from a specific endpoint. The code fails to properly validate input before passing it to WordPress's `do_shortcode()` function.

### Affected Code

```php
// Vulnerable code in the plugin
function process_user_input() {
    $user_input = isset($_GET['param']) ? $_GET['param'] : '';
    
    // No sanitization or validation!
    echo do_shortcode($user_input);
}
```

### Proof of Concept

The vulnerability can be triggered using a simple GET request:

```
https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=vulnerable_action&param=[shortcode_to_execute]
```

For example, using the WordPress `wp_get_archives` shortcode to extract post history:

```
https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=vulnerable_action&param=[wp_get_archives type=monthly]
```

## Impact

This vulnerability allows an attacker to:

1. Execute any shortcode registered in the WordPress environment
2. Potentially access sensitive information depending on installed plugins
3. Perform XSS attacks through specially crafted shortcodes
4. In some cases, achieve remote code execution if vulnerable shortcodes are installed

## Mitigation

If you're using the affected plugin:

1. Update to version 2.5.8 or newer immediately
2. Implement proper Web Application Firewall rules to block suspicious requests
3. Consider implementing additional access controls to limit unauthenticated access
